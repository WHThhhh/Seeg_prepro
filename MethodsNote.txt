SOs detection:
	1.bandpass 0.16-1.25Hz, order 3, only N2\3
	2.find all cross-0 points, 2 successive p2n for  Cz and n2p for iEEG (0.8-2s; 0.5-1.25Hz)
	3.only top 25% amplitudes remain in SO candidates
	4.然后tmd随机抽几段原始数据，手动验证一下
	5.lock time to the down state(trough/peak) and epoch-2.5s to 2.5s from raw data

Spindles:
	1.bandpass 12-16Hz, order 3, only N2\3
	2.200ms moving RMS window, 75% RMS value for amplitude threshold
	3.find all 0.5-3s RMS signal beyond thre
	4.然后也是tmd手动验证一下
	5.lock time to the maximum of spindles and epoch-2.5s to 2.5s from raw data

Ripples:
	1.bandpass 80-100Hz, same
	2.20ms moving RMS window, 99% RMS value for amplitude threshold
	3.find all 38ms longer RMS signal beyond thre
	4.Raw data must have 3 discrete troughs/peaks
	5.lock time to the maximum ripple peak and epoch-1.5s to 1.5s from raw data
